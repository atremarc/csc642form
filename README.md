For this project I was required to create a form page where user data is collected and displayed on the next page. Not only was it required that this information be collected, but it was required that the manditory fields are filled out, the terms of service is agreed to, and google captcha is checked. Then this information is used to plot the address given in a google maps display using the google maps API.
